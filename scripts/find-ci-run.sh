# The Release workflow publishes the paclets that this run built and verified. GitHub can
# list a run some time after it finishes, so while no run is listed the lookup is tried
# again every CI_RUN_WAIT seconds, CI_RUN_TRIES times in all: by default 10 tries 30 seconds
# apart, about five minutes. A failed gh command counts as no run, and its message stays in
# the log.
